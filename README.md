# DSA Activity Selection Project

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the **Activity Selection Problem** using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The Activity Selection Problem is a classic **Greedy Algorithm** problem where the goal is to select the maximum number of activities that don't overlap in time.

## Features
- Input activities with start and end times.
- Visual representation of activities.
- Algorithm implementation to calculate the maximum number of non-overlapping activities.
- Display of selected activities.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Structure of the web page.
- **CSS**: Styling and layout.
- **JavaScript**: Implementation of the Activity Selection algorithm and interactivity.
- **Python**: Backend implementation of the Activity Selection algorithm and data processing

## How It Works
1. **Input Activities**: The user provides a list of activities with their start and end times.
2. **Sorting**: The activities are sorted based on their end times.
3. **Selection**: Using the Greedy Algorithm, activities are selected such that no two activities overlap.
4. **Output**: The selected activities are displayed on the screen.

## Files
- `index.html`: Contains the structure of the web page.
- `style.css`: Contains the styling for the web page.
- `script.js`: Contains the logic for the Activity Selection Problem.

## Usage
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
3. Enter activities and click on the "Calculate" button to see the result.

## Example
### Input
| Activity | Start Time | End Time |
|----------|------------|----------|
| A        | 1          | 2        |
| B        | 3          | 4        |
| C        | 0          | 6        |
| D        | 5          | 7        |
| E        | 8          | 9        |

### Output
Selected Activities: A, B, E

## Future Enhancements
- Allow users to upload activities via a file.
- Add animations for better visualization.
- Extend support for other greedy algorithm problems.
